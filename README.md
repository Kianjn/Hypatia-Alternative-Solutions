# Enhancements to Hypatia for Generating Near-Optimal Solutions (NOS)

This repository contains the work from my master's thesis, which focuses on enhancing the Hypatia energy modeling platform to generate near-optimal solutions (NOS). The modified version of Hypatia applies heuristic methods, including crossover and evolution techniques, to explore a diverse decision-space of energy system configurations.

## üåü Key Contributions
1. **Modifications to Hypatia**:
   - Integration of machine learning to iteratively adjust input parameters based on previous results.
   - Implementation of a heuristic NOS generation method, leveraging crossover and evolution techniques.

2. **Application to the Italian Energy Sector**:
   - Scenarios modeled for Italy's energy transition toward carbon neutrality.
   - Comparative analysis of results obtained through traditional optimization and NOS generation.

3. **Decision-Space Analysis**:
   - Visualization of diverse energy configurations within acceptable cost and emission thresholds.

## üîó Original Hypatia Platform
This project builds on the open-source [Hypatia platform](https://github.com/SESAM-Polimi/hypatia) developed by SESAM at Politecnico di Milano.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `data/`: Input datasets and parameters specific to the Italian energy sector.
- `models/`: Python scripts, including:
  - The modified Hypatia framework.
  - NOS generation methods.
- `results/`: Outputs from simulations and decision-space visualizations.
